#### This repository is an example of a shipping optimization tool. The goal of the tool is to be able to feed it data and have it recommend the optimal shipping method based on our constraints. In this example we are using two sets of data. One containing information about the order and another with information about the available shipping services. We then apply linear programming to create an optimization model that will read the order data and recommend the optimal shipping service based on our constraints.
