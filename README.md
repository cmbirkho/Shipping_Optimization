#### The code in this repository is an example of a shipping optimization tool. 

#### The goal is to simulate an ecommerce environment where orders come in to an order management system and need to be assigned a shipping service before the order data drops into the distribution center's warehouse management system. We'll create that process of assigning the shipping service, but doing so in a way that optimizes our business constraints (i.e. costs, customer service, etc.)

#### We'll be using linear programming and the `lpSolveAPI` library for the optimization.
